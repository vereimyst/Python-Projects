Planning to add more details on exactly what each file does what (maybe update/work on them again)... maybe I'll reupload them with actual names instead of food- that would help wouldn't it?

Notes before then: Chocolate Bar (2).py is the Banking Interface w/ attempted data storage (ignore Chocolate Bar)
