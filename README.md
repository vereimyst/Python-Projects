# Coding-Experiments

Planning to add more details on exactly what each file does what (maybe update/work on them again)...
Maybe I'll give them with actual names instead of food- that would help wouldn't it? Yes it really did help :)

Banking:
 - online bank interface:
    - login
    - question
    - withdraw, deposit, check bal
 - tried to store info in txts
 - read back info from txt (<account_id>.txt; mr.txt is sample, not sure if it actually works anymore (I forgot))
 - stuff to add is stuff I'm thinking about implementing when I stop stressing over nothing
 - used to be ChocolateBar(2)

DontLookOmg.py 
 - IGNORE
    - lot of time.sleep in there... and I mean a lot a lot
 - OG Banking code
 - does not include data storage
 - used to be ChocolateBar

PracticeIntro:
 - IGNORE ALSO
 - simple program I started on when learning python syntax
 - basic functions
    - defining variables
    - strings
    - booleans
    - ints
    - print
    - time
    - while loops (I forget why there are no for loops)
    - if statements
 - used to be ApplePie

Not as relevant since I changed some things recently, but old acct/ver can be found at https://github.com/HappyFacesYay/. From the username alone, you can probably see why I just made a new account...
